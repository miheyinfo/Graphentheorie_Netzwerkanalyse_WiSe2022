Many papers demonstrate the impact of news sentiment on stock prices. The present paper aimed to investigate whether media coverage of stocks is based on the industry sector of the covered company, as well as the existence of a correlation between news sentiment and stock price performance over a specific timeframe. With this intention, we formulated a model using actual Alpha Vantage API data and examined it within a graph-based Neo4J database.\\
Our findings indicate that the media tends to concentrate on companies and their related industry sectors when covering stocks. However, we also revealed that there is no discernible relationship between news sentiment and the performance of a company's stock price.
